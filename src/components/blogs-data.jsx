By reducing clutter and emphasizing streamlined fixtures, the space feels more open, airy, and calming. Floating vanities, frameless glass showers, and wall-mounted toilets are popular choices that embody this sleek aesthetic. \n- Natural Materials: Incorporating natural elements like wood, stone, or ceramic tiles adds warmth and texture to the space. Materials such as marble countertops, bamboo cabinetry, or slate flooring offer a timeless elegance that complements modern design. \n- Smart Technology: Today’s modern bathrooms are smarter than ever, with technology enhancing convenience and comfort. Features like touchless faucets, heated floors, digital shower controls, and smart mirrors with built-in lighting elevate the user experience. \n- Bold Accents and Lighting: While minimalism is key, adding bold accents can create focal points that draw attention. Statement mirrors, black matte fixtures, or patterned tiles provide a touch of personality. Layered lighting, including task, ambient, and accent lighting, ensures functionality and atmosphere."

Double- or triple-pane glass, Low-E coatings, and insulated frames help maximize natural light while maintaining indoor temperatures. DMV-GC Group offers a range of energy-efficient options to keep your home comfortable and eco-friendly. \n- Skylights and Roof Windows: Skylights and roof windows are excellent for spaces where wall windows are limited, such as attics, bathrooms, or staircases. They bring sunlight into areas that are otherwise difficult to illuminate. \n- Sliding or French Doors with Glass Panels: Replacing solid doors with glass-paneled sliding or French doors can bring more light into adjoining spaces. These options work particularly well for patios or backyards, enhancing both light and access. \n- Transom Windows: Adding transom windows above existing windows or doors is a subtle yet impactful way to increase light without sacrificing privacy.",
